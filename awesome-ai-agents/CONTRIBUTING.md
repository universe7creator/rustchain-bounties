2. **Ensure it meets quality standards**:
   - Active development (commits within last 6 months)
   - Clear documentation
   - Open source license (for tools/frameworks)
   - Unique value proposition (not a duplicate of existing tools)
3. **Verify the link works** - Test all URLs before submitting

## Submission Guidelines

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add/my-awesome-agent
   ```

2. **Add your item** following the style guide below

3. **Update the Table of Contents** if adding a new category

4. **Commit your changes** with a clear message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: [Tool Name] - [Brief description]"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin add/my-awesome-agent
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title describing what you're adding
   - Description explaining why the tool/resource is valuable
   - Link to the project's repository or website
   - Any relevant context or usage notes

### PR Title Format

- Adding a tool: `Add: [Tool Name] - [One-line description]`
- Adding a resource: `Add: [Resource Name] to [Category]`
- Fixing a link: `Fix: Update broken link for [Tool Name]`
- Documentation: `Docs: [Description of change]`

## Style Guide

### List Item Format

```markdown
- **[Tool Name](link)** - Brief description (max 15 words). `Language/Platform` `License`
```

Example:
```markdown
- **[AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT)** - Autonomous GPT-4 agent that can accomplish complex tasks. `Python` `MIT`
```

### Category Organization

- Place items in the most relevant category
- Keep categories alphabetically sorted
- Within categories, items can be sorted by popularity or alphabetically
- Use subcategories for large sections (10+ items)

### Description Guidelines

- **Be concise**: Maximum 15 words
- **Be specific**: What does it do? What's unique about it?
- **Avoid hype**: No "best", "amazing", "revolutionary" - let the tool speak for itself
- **Include key info**: Language, platform, or license when relevant

### Link Format

- Use HTTPS links when available
- Link to the main project page or repository
- For GitHub repos, use the repository URL (not the org page)

### Badges and Icons

Optional badges can be added after the description:

```markdown
- **[Tool Name](link)** - Description. ![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/user/repo)
```

## Review Process

### What We Look For

1. **Relevance**: Is it related to AI agents?
2. **Quality**: Is it well-documented and maintained?
3. **Uniqueness**: Does it offer something different from existing items?
4. **Accessibility**: Is it open source or have a free tier?
5. **Accuracy**: Are links working and descriptions correct?

### Timeline

- Initial review: 3-5 business days
- Feedback incorporation: 1-2 iterations typical
- Merge: After approval from a maintainer

### Common Reasons for Rejection

- Duplicate of existing item
- Broken or inaccessible links
- Insufficient documentation
- Not actively maintained
- Commercial product with no free tier (unless exceptional value)
- Description is too long or promotional
